Hi Shannon!

Sorry this website is a bit bland (at least for my tastes) but I thought of this idea too last minute to make it more pretty...but I tried my best! I literally had to read through and expermiment with so many different options of setting up a website before settling on this one (aka what I was "busy" with earlier this week LOL). I know it's not the best but it's the thought that counts right? And I think you already see me as a tech guru so this would just impress you more heh. Anyways, I know last year you got sad on your birthday because you felt like no one wanted to celebrate your birthday with you BUT I'M CHANGING THAT THIS YEAR. I asked around for everyone to submit messages and/or photos for this project just to remind you that **we care and think about you**! A LOTTO, if I may add and especially on your birthday. And thus this is the resulting 3-day project :3 

You can navigate to the "Messages" section, where all our messages to you are, either through the navigation bar at the top of the page or click [here](./messages.html). Similarily, you can navigate to the "Memories" section to view pictures that were submited either through the navigation bar at the top of the page or click [here](./memories.html). Happy exploring!

Love,  
Your #1 fan üíú

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
