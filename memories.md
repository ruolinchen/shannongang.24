# Surprise!!
## …there’s nothing here?

So this was supposed to be a page of photos and memories that other people have with you but I didn’t have the time to:

1) Organize any photos people might have sent me and/or   
2) Collect photos to display here  

Also it may have just been too last minute for people to find pictures :cc I thought it would be cute, and more interesting, if I had messages AND photos to share with you but I think I was just too ambitious. I did not expect to have this much work to do at work for like the third or fourth week in a row... nor did I expect to have practices basically every day of this week... and a bunch of other stuff I've probably complained to you about... I’m sorry ;-; I promise I’ll get around to updating this page, if not with pictures other people sent then with cute pictures of us hehe

Love,   
Someone who cried, and died, a little on the inside because she couldn’t put together the perfect website/gift ;-;
