_Happy birthday Shannon! Congratulations on getting older and a year closer to your mid-life crisis! HAHA jokes aside, thank you for putting up with my crazy antics so far and thank you for being there for me all the time! Can’t wait to hang out with you more in the future! <3_

_Another year passes and your birthday is here! Happy birthday Shannon ! :D
We’ve been through thick and thin throughout the years, and had a bunch of our own life problems, but I’m glad we have each other’s backs. I’m happy to call you my friend! I hope your birthday is full of cakes and happiness :^D_

_Happy Birthday!_ 생일축하해! _We met a short time ago, but I am sure that our friendship will be one that lasts long. Welcome to OLDAGE! You probably started having backaches and knee pains. But dance until you break your bones. I wish you all the joy, happiness, laughter, and good food that you deserve on this day._ 아주이쁜 엘렌 언니가 ㅋㅋㅋ

_HAPPY BIRTHDAY SHANNON!!! I’ve only known you for a short time but I’m so glad to have met you and I can’t wait to continue to grow our friendship :) Thank you for putting up with all your 12 children at RTL practice and for being our go-to soju tornado maker XD I hope you have an amazing birthday! <3_

_Ayyye Happy Birthday Shannon!! I hope you've been well in this wild world. It's good to see you dancing again! And now you can dance with the passage of time too( ╹▽╹ ) But I always thought you were the coolest person I know (not to mention our shared Naruto comradery) So keep being awesome for many years to come!_

_It's that time of the year again! Time to say HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SHANNON!  Wow, how does it feel to be old, eh? Smh, feels like yesterday when you called me old when I say I'm 24 🙃._ 现在你跟我一样老了! 
_What comes with age is life experience and many more happy memories :") And you're going to have so much more of that coming your way! I'm not very good with the heathotd-heart stuff but I do want to let you know that I appreciate your existence lol. Even though we don't hang out much, I still feel I would consider you to be a close friend. Which is kinda weird, haha. But I think that's the special thing about you. it's your little magic_ (亲切感) _and I just want to point out that I really appreciate that about you (and of course there's other things I can brag about to other people like your professional dance skills XD)._ 

_I know that last year was a roller coaster ride for you personally and professionally so I hope you can at least learn to relax today. Hope your 24 will be full of sunshine and rainbows! If not I'm always all ears if you need anyone to vent to;) Have lots of sweets and happy times and lots and lots of good food!!_

_P.s. we really need to take some pictures together, just realized the only pictures that I have to mark our times together are only those of the foods and drinks we 😞_

_P.P.s. I'm betting on the chance that I'm the only Zinnia you know so I don't have to put my last name here lol._

_24 years old, huh? It feels just like yesterday when you all were barely 18/19. (Please stop getting older, it makes me feel really old. T_T)
Welcome to the mid-20s club! You’ve officially aged out of getting pity for any shortcomings in life, teenagers will think you’re ancient, adults will think you’re basically 2 years old, and your joints will slowly start to creak, 1 by 1. (OOOOOOOOO, scaaaaary.)_

_But it’s not all bad~ You’re the same age that Jack Dempsey was when he became heavyweight champion of the world, so I think you’ve still got some pep in you!_

_Keep on dancing and doing your thing! You got it, dude! (Or...something, I guess.)_

_In all seriousness, I hope that you have a wonderful birthday! I hope that it brings you lots of joy and lots of love. You’re only 24 once, so enjoy it, kiddo._

_PS. I’m betting on the chance that I’m not the only Michael that you know, so I wrote my last name in all caps, just so you know who the real Michael is. :D_
