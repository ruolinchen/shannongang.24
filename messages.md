_Happy birthday Shannon! Congratulations on getting older and a year closer to your mid-life crisis! HAHA jokes aside, thank you for putting up with my crazy antics so far and thank you for being there for me all the time! Can’t wait to hang out with you more in the future! <3_

_Another year passes and your birthday is here! Happy birthday Shannon ! :D
We’ve been through thick and thin throughout the years, and had a bunch of our own life problems, but I’m glad we have each other’s backs. I’m happy to call you my friend! I hope your birthday is full of cakes and happiness :^D_

_Happy Birthday!_ 생일축하해! _We met a short time ago, but I am sure that our friendship will be one that lasts long. Welcome to OLDAGE! You probably started having backaches and knee pains. But dance until you break your bones. I wish you all the joy, happiness, laughter, and good food that you deserve on this day._ 아주이쁜 엘렌 언니가 ㅋㅋㅋ
