> Another year passes and your birthday is here! Happy birthday Shannon ! :D
We’ve been through thick and thin throughout the years, and had a bunch of our own life problems, but I’m glad we have each other’s backs. I’m happy to call you my friend! I hope your birthday is full of cakes and happiness :^D
